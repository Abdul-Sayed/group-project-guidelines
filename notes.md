Discord is great for screen sharing and holding group chats... gitkraken is a great GUI for github, vs code has some great extensions like git lens ( able to see who coded what) having daily stand ups with your group is great practice and any sort of task management program where you can create tasks and assign them (something like Jira) is great practice as well.


Come up with User Stories
use SCRUM/AGILE to help set up a work flow. 
Discuss how to split up the work, whether working by features or frontend/backend.
Highly suggest you all work together to build a file structure for the project (Alternatively someone can setup a github repo)
Have a Dev branch where you will be merging or submitting Pull Requests to (When you guys have a working product, merge your dev branch onto Master)
When making new branches for a feature, have your name followed by the feature you’re working on. Try to create branch from Dev
Recommend you Setup a linter file to the project that everyone on the team can follow. (This helps alot!)
Setup a gitignore file and add node_modules, package.lock, and other files you don’t want pushed to the repo
If multiple people are going to be working on a feature or frontend/backend, then pair program to get enough up to the part where you can split off
Set up code sprints (hourly or daily)
Highly suggest stand-ups with the whole team beginning and end of day (you can include mid day as well)
Pair Program through errors (extra set of eyes helps alot, sometimes you just need to rubber duck as well)
Commit frequently (Before merging, speak with team on changes/features made and make sure it works)
Have descriptive commit messages (helps through code reviews and whenever you need to revert back to a commit)
Comment your code! (For your and your teams sake)
Add testing after features are done or follow a TDD approach (Enzyme for React, Jest for Unit Testing) (Also makes you look more professional)
